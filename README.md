# Object_Detection_Code
This will be done in Python on Visual Studio Code, a source code editor on Windows. 
I will be using a pre-established open source configuration path (contains the learning 
model class for the general objects) and weights path (provides the ability to distinguish 
between objects). When I completed the facial detection code I realized that I would not have 
the ability to create an accurate enough learning model to fit the needs of our robot so I have 
decided to use those paths. From there, OpenCV has an integrated function that specifically uses 
those paths for object detection. Then once completing that I will attempt to move the program onto 
a microcontroller using a USB webcam.
