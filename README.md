# Facial Detection/Recognition Code
I have completed all the programing in Python using OpenCV on Visual Studio Code, a source code editor on Windows, running it through my personal USB Webcam. Using the algorithms provided by OpenCVâ€™s GitHub, the program allows one to recognize any person through a webcam. This holds true so long as enough headshots of that person are imported into the training data when creating the facial recognition class that will then be used by the main script. 

When I completed the facial detection code I realized that I would not have the ability to create an accurate enough learning model to fit the needs of our robot. 

OpenCV has an integrated function that specifically uses configuration paths  and weighted paths for facial detection so it was pretty straight foward. Many many helpful references/guides online. I have added comments to all the code seen so nothing should be a mystery.
