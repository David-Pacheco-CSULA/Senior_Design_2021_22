# Facial Detection/Recognition Code
This has been done in Python on Visual Studio Code, a source code editor on Windows. Using the algorithms provided by OpenCV’s GitHub, the program allows one to recognize any person through a webcam. This holds true so long as enough headshots of that person are imported into the training data when creating the facial recognition class that will then be used by the main script. However, due to the scope change this won’t be used this year.
