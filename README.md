# Object_Detection_Code
I have completed all the programing in Python using OpenCV on Visual Studio Code, a source code 
editor on Windows, running it through my personal USB Webcam. 
I have been using a pre-established open source configuration path (contains the learning 
model class for the general objects) and weights path (provides the ability to distinguish 
between objects). 
When I completed the facial detection code I realized that I would not have 
the ability to create an accurate enough learning model to fit the needs of our robot so I have 
decided to use those paths. From there, OpenCV has an integrated function that specifically uses 
those paths for object detection so it was pretty straight foward. Many many helpful references/guides online.
I have added comments to all the code seen so nothing should be a mystery.
